The super power of machine learning algorithms is seemingly able to approximate any unknown pattern with a set of rules by generalizing from the train data. The train data are samples generated by the unkown target pattern.  The set of rules normally consist of two components: 1) a specific form of mathematical equations, and 2) values of paramteres used in those equations. For instance, a linear regression which is trained to predict house price can be expressed by $f(x, b) = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2$, where $[b0, b1, b2]$ is found through a series of optimization procedure with train data.
