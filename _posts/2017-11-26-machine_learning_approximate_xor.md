In this article, we will try a selection of algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM and Neural Network) to examine their abilities to learn a non-linear pattern (XOR). The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the importance of choosing a proper size of depth (number of hidden layers) in neural network. The super power of machine learning algorithms is seemingly able to approximate any patterns with a set of rules by generalizing from the train data. The train data are samples generated by the unknown target pattern.  The set of rules normally consist of two components: 1) a specific form of mathematical equation(s), and 2) values of parameters used in this equation. For instance, a linear regression which is trained to predict house price can be expressed as $f(x, b) = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2$, where $[b0, b1, b2]$ is found through a series of optimization procedure with train data.
