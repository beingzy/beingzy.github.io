Hi, Dear visitors,

I am a engineering manager at Ant Financial in China, after spending 9-year in US for PhD education and career. Previously, I had worked as
Data Scientist at Pinterest and earned PhD degree from University of Cincinnati. I had lived or worked in a number of cities: Cincinnati, Columbus OH, San Francisco, San Mateo and Chengdu (now). 

I would like to share my thoughts on various topics mainly related to life & work of a tech worker. Occassionally, I may write some articles on my observations on changing society as Chinese citizens. 

Enjoy your reading.
