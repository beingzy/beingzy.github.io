Hello,

I am Yi, a Chinese guy, approaching my 30. This is my blog, a place where I intend to share some technical discussions on playing with data. On a random basis, I may also want to share my thoughts on humanity and tech world. Hope you can find things which can interest you. If those articles were not useful for you now, feel free to read something else which is more interesting.

Seize your day!

-Yi
