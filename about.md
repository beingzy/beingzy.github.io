Hi,

This is my personal blog. I am a tech worker, currently serving as a data scientist at Pinterest inc. My original intention is to blog for sharing what I learned or stuff which interests me.

The range of topics of contents here should be wide as the volume grows. Wish receive intelligent feedback from random audience.

Let Karma lead me to the unpredictables.

-Yi
