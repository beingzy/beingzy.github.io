Hello, Strangers,

I am Yi, a Chinese guy, approaching his 30. This is my blog, a place where I intend to share some technical discussion on playing with data. On random basis, I may also want to share my thoughts on humanity and tech world. Hope you can find things which can interest you. Otherwise, I encourage you to spend time more wisely. 

Seize your day!

-Yi
