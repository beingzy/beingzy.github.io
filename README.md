## Introduction
This is my personal website empowered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which
allows me write new posts with markdown syntax. The website reside on github. I
will blog about technology, random thoughts and my life occasionally.

## Features
In this section, we will list the wanted features alongside the marks to indicate
the progress of the implementation of a feature. The main purpose of the list
is to help me track the features.

The feature list is:
* install google analytics tracker [Done]
* add disqus comment systems
* add footer per blog page
